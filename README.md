# Holberton School Curriculum: 0x04 Implement a design from scratch

## Project

1. [Implement a design from scratch](https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/1685)

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) will be your friend!

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

During these projects, you won‚Äôt have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

It‚Äôs not an easy exercise, but it will be your life in company/start-up, you will discuss with designers, implement their work and make them review your implementation.

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

* reset CSS styling
* use variables
* simple/‚Äúas generic as you can‚Äù CSS selectors
* avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
* simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

Now, your turn!

Here is the final result on mobile, desktop, and tablet versions:

## TASKS
### 0. Read and be familiar with Figma
Create an account in Figma and open this [project](https://www.figma.com/file/gkWRcFqkwtruWZgSfnnHF0/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?node-id=0%3A1) and ‚ÄúDuplicate to your Drafts‚Äù to have access to all design details.

#### Important notes with Figma:

* some values are in float - feel free to round them
* For this task, please write an amazing README.md

#### Interactions note:

* the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
* links hover/active: #FF6565
* button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
* max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

### 1. Header
Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

* reset CSS styling
* use variables
* simple/‚Äúas generic as you can‚Äù CSS selectors
* avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
* simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it‚Äôs fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

##### Repo:
````
GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 0-index.html, 0-styles.css
````

### 2. "What we do..." section
* Copy files from the previous task.
* For this second task: create the ‚ÄúWhat we do‚Ä¶‚Äù section
* In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can‚Ä¶ you will probably need some components in next section.

##### Repo:
````
GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 1-index.html, 1-styles.css
````

### 3. "Our results" section
* Copy files from the previous task.
* For this third task: create the ‚ÄúOur results‚Äù section
* Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

##### Repo:
````
GitHub repository: holberton-headphones
File: 2-index.html, 2-styles.css
````

### 4. Contact us
* Copy files from the previous task.
* A good landing page has always a contact form.
* You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

##### Repo:
